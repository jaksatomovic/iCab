# Requirements
 - Swift 4+
 - Xcode 9+

# Installation ðŸ”¥

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over eighteen thousand libraries and can help you scale your projects elegantly. 


Libraries used: 
      - Alamofire
      - CodableAlamofire
      - AHKActionSheet
      - SwipeTransition
      
      
You can install them with the following command:

```bash
$ cd ProjectFolder
$ pod install
```

## Run

```bash
$ cd ProjectFolder
$ open iCab.xcworkspace/
```

Simply hit run button and start app on your simulator, but for better experience I recommend to use real device.
